Like no one ever was 
To catch them is my real test 
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Pokemon to understand
The power thats inside

Pokemon, gotta catch em all
Its you and me
I know its my destiny
Pokemon
Oh, youre my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and Ill teach you
Pokemon
gotta catch em all
Gotta catch em all

Yeah

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
Theres no better team
Arm in arm well win the fight
Its always been our dream

Pokemon, gotta catch em all
Its you and me
I know its my destiny
Pokemon
Oh, youre my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and Ill teach you
Pokemon

Gotta catch em all
Gotta catch em all

Gotta catch em all
Gotta catch em all
