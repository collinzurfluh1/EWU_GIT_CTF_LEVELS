# make-git-better

Welcome to the first REAL stage of the CTF :) 

## Your challenge

1. Add 2 files to the root of the repo: `alice.txt` and `bob.txt`.
2. Commit your changes (should be only one commit!).
3. Push your changes to the remote repo.
4. If you did it right, you should get your flag.

## What do I do with the flag
